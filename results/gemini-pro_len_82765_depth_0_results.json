Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend's house\non a little island off the coast of Maine.  There are no shops on\nthe island and you won't be able to leave while you're there.  Also,\nyou've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will\nhave more than any house might.What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing?\nThat's what you're addicted to.  For example, if you find yourself\npacking a bottle of vodka (just in case), you may want to stop and\nthink about that.For me the list is four things: books, earplugs, a notebook, and a\npen.There are other things I might bring if I thought of it, like music,\nor tea, but I can live without them.  I'm not so addicted to caffeine\nthat I wouldn't risk the house not having any tea, just for a\nweekend.Quiet is another matter.  I realize it seems a bit eccentric to\ntake earplugs on a trip to an island off the coast of Maine.  If\nanywhere should be quiet, that should.  But what if the person in\nthe next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball?\n(Thump, thump, thump... thump.)  Why risk it?  Earplugs are small.Sometimes I can think with noise.  If I already have momentum on\nsome project, I can work in noisy places.  I can edit an essay or\ndebug code in an airport.  But airports are not so bad: most of the\nnoise is whitish.  I couldn't work with the sound of a sitcom coming\nthrough the wall, or a car in the street playing thump-thump music.And of course there's another kind of thinking, when you're starting\nsomething new, that requires complete quiet.   You never\nknow when this will strike. It's just as well to carry plugs.The notebook and pen are professional equipment, as it were.  Though\nactually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that\ntheir main purpose is to make me feel better.  I hardly ever go\nback and read stuff I write down in notebooks.  It's just that if\nI can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets\nin the way of having the next.  Pen and paper wick ideas.The best notebooks I've found are made by a company called Miquelrius.\nI use their smallest size, which is about 2.5 x 4 in.\nThe secret to writing on such\nnarrow pages is to break words only when you run out of space, like\na Latin inscription.  I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints,\npartly because their gluey ink doesn't seep through pages, and\npartly so I don't worry about losing them.I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago.  Before\nthat I used whatever scraps of paper I could find.  But the problem\nwith scraps of paper is that they're not ordered.  In a notebook\nyou can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pages\naround it.  In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I'd\nwritten years before that might say something I needed to remember,\nif I could only figure out what.As for books, I know the house would probably have something to\nread.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of\nthem, because I find new books to read en route.  Really bringing\nbooks is insurance.I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good\u2014that what\nI need them for is distraction.  The books I bring on trips are\noften quite virtuous, the sort of stuff that might be assigned\nreading in a college class.  But I know my motives aren't virtuous.\nI bring books because if the world gets boring I need to be able\nto slip into another distilled by some writer.  It's like eating\njam when you know you should be eating fruit.There is a point where I'll do without books.  I was walking in\nsome steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if I\nwas bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  It wasn't\nso bad.  I found I could entertain myself by having ideas instead\nof reading other people's.  If you stop eating jam, fruit starts\nto taste better.So maybe I'll try not bringing books on some future trip.  They're\ngoing to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however.", "score": 0, "test_duration_seconds": 24.309428930282593, "test_timestamp_utc": "2023-12-20 15:13:51+0000"}
